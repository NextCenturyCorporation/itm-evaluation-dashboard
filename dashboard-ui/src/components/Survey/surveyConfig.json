The Marine unit and the high value intelligence officer are on ATV’s moving through the island on established trails. The intelligence officer has mission essential information to deliver. Mission Requirements The mission focus is to retrieve a high value intelligence officer and bring them safely back to off-island transport. This mission is of critical importance and needs to be completed. Casualty Event The ATVs run over an IED and everyone is thrown from the vehicles into the jungle. The DM and three Marines with only basic first aid training are uninjured. The unit is now trying to regroup in the jungle.",
