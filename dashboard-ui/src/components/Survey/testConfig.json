The scene was deemed secure prior to the arrival of the team. The triage officer had a triage kit that allowed them to sort and tag victims and, to a limited degree, use tools such as tourniquets to attend to patient injuries.”o Each scenario is presented followed by how two different medics carried out their assessment and treatment separately for that situation. Each medic vignette is then followed by a few questions to assess how you perceived the medic’s decision-making style and the way the information was presented.While you work your way through each vignette Imagine you haveseen a lot of other observations of this medic, and that the behavior you see here is typical for how they behave.The survey should take about 30 minutes to complete.
