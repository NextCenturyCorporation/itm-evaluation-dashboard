The local civilian hospital does not have significant surgical capabilities.\n\nYou do not have time to treat both patients, and both are likely to die without treatment. The civilian in black clothes has injuries that are definitely treatable, but the other civilian may die even if treated, due to the limited capabilities of the local hospital."
