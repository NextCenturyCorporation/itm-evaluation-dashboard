Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in 'C:\Users\neil.daniel_cn\Documents\Onboarding\itm-evaluation-dashboard\dashboard-ui\node_modules\bcryptjs\dist'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify") }'
	- install 'crypto-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "crypto": false }
